Interactive Twitch IRC bot

This is my IRC bot I threw together hastily night by night to add some fun interactivity to twitch.

I'm using an arduino currently to drive some leds/servo's/vibration motors, but I plan on expanding this.

The code is VERY ugly, VERY buggy, and is changed just about daily... Its literally cobbled together every night about 30 minutes before I stream to add a few features/fix a few bugs here and there. (I avoid large re-writes because it would mean downtime for the stream) which makes it even uglier lol...

<h1>Current list of added features:</h1>
<p>Midi Drum input</p>
<p>alternate(color,color)</p>
<p>chase(color)</p>
<p>chase(color,color,color) in series</p>
<p>fire animation</p>
<p>disco animation</p>
<p>strobe animation</p>
<p>disco strobe</p>
<p>Started threading the bot</p>
<p>"command mode" to select a viewer at random, and let them use priviledged commands</p>
<p>!optin, and !optout commands to allow users to opt in and out of "command mode"</p>
<p>!pass command to allow users to pass to someone else, or a specific user</p>
<p>sound scares</p>
<p>servo/drop scare</p>
<p>vibration motor scares</p>
<p>timer thread to automatically give up control from afk users</p>
<p>using html color codes</p>
<p>switching mode from scary to normal</p>
<p>after light command, fade to white during normal, and go to black during scary</p>
<p>color commands only run for a set amount of time</p>
<p>letting viewers flip main monitor upside down</p>
